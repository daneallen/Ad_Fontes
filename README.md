# Ad Fontes STEM Project 2025



# Ideas for improvement

   - [x] lighten the colors for on the front of the badge for more contrast
   - [x] enlarge the test on the back of the badge... possibly expand/point out the different components
   - [x] remove the svg2mod on the front silkscreen
   - [x] better align the image on the front of the badge
   - [x] fix/address/remove the white parts near the mouse bites
   - [x] buy the stencil for mass production
   - [x] add a box and label for initials

## v02 Improvements

   - Move all 4 of the fiducial to the BACK of the board
   - Label the positive and negative (on the back) of the LEDs
   - Actually label the LEDs
   - update the v02 (really v03) on the copper pour on the back
